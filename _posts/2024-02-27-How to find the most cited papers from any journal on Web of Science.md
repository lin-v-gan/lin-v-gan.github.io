*I wanted to provide screenshots, but unfortunately `Attempt to authenticate non-existent session` won't go away... Sorry!*

### Step 1
Access `Web of Science Core Collection` from NYU Library: [https://guides.nyu.edu/az.php?a=w](https://guides.nyu.edu/az.php?a=w). 

Log in using your NYU credentials.

If you are prompted with `Attempt to authenticate non-existent session`, clear the cookies for `nyu.edu` and `duosecurity.com`. Then try again.

### Step 2
In the dropdown menu, select `Publication/Source Titles`. 

In the textbox, type in the `name of the journal` you want to search. 

Click `Search`.

### Step 3
In the dropdown menu next to `Sort by`, select `Citation`.

You can obviously sort by other things too!

### Step 4
In the dropdown menu next to `Export`, select `Excel (.xlsx)`.

Choose the `number of entires` you'd like to include.

Done! ðŸ¥³
