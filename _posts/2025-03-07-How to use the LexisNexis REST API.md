title: How to use the LexisNexis REST API

*post under construction*

The most helpful guide I've found is from Stanford Library: [[link]](https://guides.library.stanford.edu/lexis-nexis-api/building_searches)
* They even have example scripts! [[link]](https://code.stanford.edu/katie.frey/python-lexisnexis-scripts)

The main thing to keep in mind is the limits. 
> The limits are 5 searches per minute, 200 searches per hour, 1000 searches per day. 
> Each credential is also limited to accessing 50,000 documents per day.
> Each “search” = 50 articles.
